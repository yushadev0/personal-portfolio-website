# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

You can visit [here](https://hasup.net)

The website serves as a space to present my projects, experiments, and
approach to software development. It is designed as a living archive rather
than a finished product.

The live version is hosted separately and may differ slightly from the
code in this repository over time.
