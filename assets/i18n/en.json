Just go to the settings gear in the upper right, select the 'Skin' option as 'Low Resolution' and select the 'Pixelated' option under it. These settings are very important for the pixel finding functions in the bot's working logic to work correctly. After making these settings, we return to the game with the 'Return to the game' option at the bottom of the page. We are now ready to use the bot. Running the script with the game on the screen will be enough. Although the bot sometimes bugs out and makes mistakes, it will restart the game and continue clicking. In this case, if you move your mouse to the upper left corner of your screen, the bot will stop.

           "p2":"The word 'Wiss' means 'to know' in German. I added 'io' to the end and found the name 'Wissio'.<br><br>Wissio, whose ultimate goal is purely to show questions for quiz contests, was written with Delphi and UniGUI. Users can upload their own questions to Wissio. We can achieve this thanks to the questions in JSON format. JSON format (Javascript Object Notation) has a very wide and flexible working range today; such as information exchange between server and client, APIs, configuration files, local databases.<br><br>It wouldn't be wrong to say that my intended use actually falls into the 'local database' category. Users save questions and answers in a certain format to a JSON file and upload it to Wissio. Wissio parses this JSON file and saves the questions to a hidden list. The reason for saving to the list is to save the JSON file from being constantly kept on the server and to load all the load from the server to the client. So no matter how long your questions are, even if you use millions of characters, you will only experience waiting during the file upload phase. Since all the questions are already saved in the lists during the competition, it means that you will never experience waiting during the competition. It wouldn't be wrong to call it a very good optimization example.<br><br>In this way, users can create the competition they want with the JSON editor (you can reach it here) located inside Wissio and use it with Wissio.<br><br>This project was important to me in this respect: I tried new techniques and succeeded. So I improved myself. This is a huge development for me because while designing dynamic websites with UniGUI, I was only using the UI elements offered to us by Delphi (like buttons, textareas, labels), but specifically for this application, I used elements I produced entirely with HTML and CSS. All these UI elements you see on the application are not offered by Delphi, but are elements I produced specially.<br><br>I knew this method was already possible before, but I was a little afraid to try it. With this application, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and try new things, and I am veeeery satisfied with the result I got. - Especially the 'Show Questions' button :) -",
           "p3":"Using the application is veeery simple. First, you select and upload your JSON file, which you created with the JSON editor before and which contains your questions, to Wissio with the 'Upload JSON' button. (If you cancel during the upload, it will stay on the loading screen. I couldn't solve this problem, you can refresh the page.). Then it shows you the questions so you can check them. You can hide the questions at this time. I added the question hiding feature because in crowded environments, sometimes when projected, the first few questions may have been shown to the contestants. So if you hide the questions and upload, no contestant can see your questions. Then you enter your preferred question duration. By default, it is set to 1 minute, that is, 60 seconds. You can adjust this as you wish. Finally, you are ready to start the competition.<br><br>From the moment you click the 'Start Competition' button, it means you are on the Competition screen. There is a green bar at the top of this screen. This bar is the time bar and its color slowly turns red. When it is completely finished, the answer is automatically written on the screen. You can wait as long as you want on this screen to ensure your checks. (Actually, you can't wait as long as you want because the application's timeout is 100 minutes :P) After checking, you can move on to the next question with the 'Next Question' button and start the cycle again.<br><br><br>With the links below, you can also use Wissio and have quality and fun times with your friends, family and loved ones.",
